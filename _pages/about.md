I'm a third year PhD student from University of Washington Mechanical Engineering Department. I completed my Bachelor's degree of New Energy Science and Engineering in Xi’an Jiaotong University.  

My research focus on **continuum mechanics**, **Machine learning**, and their application in **wearable electronics**.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Malakooti](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/mohammad-malakooti) at [iMatter Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/malakooti/research_1).
