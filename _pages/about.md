I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad Malakooti](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/mohammad-malakooti) at the [iMatter Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/malakooti/research_1). 

My research lies at the intersection of continuum mechanics and machine learning, with a focus on designing multifunctional composite materials for wearable electronics and soft robotics. I combine micromechanics modeling with data-driven approaches to enable soft materials discovery and inverse design.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Bachelor’s degree in New Energy Science and Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University.
