## About me

I'm a third year PhD student from University of Washington Mechanical Engineering Department. I completed my Bachelor's degree of New Energy Science and Engineering in Xi’an Jiaotong University.  

My research focus on **continuum mechanics**, **Machine learning**, and their application in **wearable electronics**.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Malakooti](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/mohammad-malakooti)) at [iMatter Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/malakooti/research_1).  

You can find my CV here: [Lijun Zhou’s Curriculum Vitae](/assets/CV.pdf)
