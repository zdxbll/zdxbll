I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad H Malakooti](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/mohammad-malakooti) at the [iMatter Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/malakooti/research_1). 

My research focuses on continuum mechanics and machine learning, particularly for multifunctional composite materials in wearable electronics and soft robotics. I integrate micromechanics modeling with data-driven approaches to enable soft materials discovery and inverse design. 

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Bachelor’s degree in New Energy Science and Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2022.
