Single-atom nanozymes with well-defined atomic structures and electronic coordination environments can effectively mimic the functions of natural enzymes. However, the costly and intricate preparation processes have hindered further exploration and application of these single-atom nanozymes. In this study, we presented a synthesis technique for creating Fe–N central single-atom doped graphene quantum dot (FeN/GQDs) nanozymes using a one-step solvothermal process, where individual iron atoms form strong bonds with graphene quantum dots through nitrogen coordination. Unlike previous studies, this method significantly simplifies the synthesis conditions for single-atom nanozymes, eliminating the need for high temperatures and employing environmentally friendly precursors derived from pineapple (ananas comosus) leaves. The resulting FeN/GQDs exhibited peroxidase-like catalytic activity and kinetics comparable to that of natural enzymes, efficiently converting H₂O₂ into hydroxyl radical species. Leveraging their excellent peroxide-like activity, FeN/GQDs nanozymes have been successfully applied to construct a colorimetric biosensor system characterized by remarkably high sensitivity for glucose detection. This achievement demonstrated a promising approach to designing single-atom nanozymes with both facile synthesis procedures and high catalytic activity, offering potential applications in wearable sensors and personalized health monitoring.
